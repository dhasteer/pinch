					<h3>Problem</h3>
					<p>Each year 321,500 Americans ages 12 and older are sexually assaulted or raped. 1 out of every 6 American women and 1 in 33 men have experienced an attempted or completed rape in their lifetime. Sexual violence is more prevalent at college in comparison to other crimes. In fact 11.2% of all students experience rape or sexual assault through physical force, violence, or incapacitation (among all graduate and undergraduate students). Only 20% of female student victims, age 18-24, report to law enforcement and students are at an increased risk during the first few months of their first and second semesters in college.</p>
					<h3>Solution</h3>
					<p>In order to address these pain points, Pinch was created. Pinch is wearable technology bracelet that keeps you highly and easily accessible to trusted friends should an uncomfortable situation arise. Pinch’s bluetooth compatibility with the Pinch app allows users to add each other to their “network.” If you’re in a precarious situation that you feel could lead to sexual assault, you simply have to pinch the sides of the Pinch bracelet and everyone in their network will be alerted with your location. Another feature is pinching a certain gesture to trigger a fake phone call to your phone. With Pinch, sexual assault can be avoided.</p>
					<h3>Why Us</h3>
					<p>A Symbol of Security- Our service provides users with a secure way to safely immerse themselves in a foreign environment, all with a simple pinch.</p>

					<h3>Product Description</h3>
					<p>Pinch is a smart, fashionable bracelet which mitigates assault rates by connecting communities through wearable technology. It all starts with a network. Say a group of friends attends a party. They simply have to bump their Pinch bracelets, and will instantly be connected on the Pinch app. Once a person has created their network, if they are in a precarious situation, which they feel could lead to assault, they just pinch the sides of the bracelet and everyone in their network will be alerted with their location. A secondary, more immediate feature is pinching the bracelet 3 times to trigger a fake phone call to the users phone in order to give users an excuse to leave the uncomfortable situation. </p>
